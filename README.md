# Welcome to the Singularity!

I have an old project called XdevL (eXtended DEVice Library) which is a platform in-depended plugin oriented programming framework. XdevL provides a mechanism that helps you to develop projects that are heavily modular. What does that mean? For example it supports plugins (as shared libraries) that gives you access to Keyboard, Mouse, Joystick, Sound, OpenGL, Network etc. 
Because I am still developing it and I needed a huge test platform I started one of my long desired projects, a Space Simulator. More about XdevL can be found at the projects site. Let's talk about Singularity for now.

More information on the Wiki page of this project.
